This is a Power BI analysis of Healthcare data of hospitals accross various countries.
There are three dimension tables (Bed_detail, Department and staff_detail) and one fact table (detail data set).

Three dashboards are created:

1. Main Dashboard: Contains the overviews of the inpatient and outpatient dashboards and has navigation buttons to navigate to the respective dashboards.
2. Inpatient Dashboard: Contains KPI analysis for KPIs like mortality rate, average treatment cost, patient to staff ratio, inpatient satisfaction rate, average inpatient rating, bed turnover rate etc.
3. Outpatient Dashboard: Contains KPI analysis for KPIs like Average age, treatment cost, patient to staff ratio, average ER time etc.

Each of the secondary dashboards contains a back button to navigate to the main dashboard. The secondary dashboards also contain more granular analysis of each KPI by using line, column and donut charts with a slicer provided for selecting the department.
